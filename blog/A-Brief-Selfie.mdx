Trying whatever I want, stick to it if interested, that's what I have insist over the track of my life till now. College students should not be constrained by their major and what they are asked to study; they are encouraged to explore themselves as well as the whole world until they are kind of sure what do they want. Despite my major in Mechanical Engineering, which I chose because it offers projects that requires knowledge robotics, design, management, I stretch into areas like Computer Science, Data science, and foreign language like Japanese. Different cultures have a lot to learn from.

Travelling and studying abroad is beneficial, that's why I'm applying graduate study in a foreign country. Meeting and contacting people from all over the world can make you stand at a much more different horizon.

I love games and animes, they are cultures rather than merely entertainments. My profile image is fanart of  character *Kinomoto Sakura*, the heroine of a well-known Japanese Anime *Cardcaptor Sakura*, and my ID Makise comes from the heroine name of *Steins: Gate*, *Makise Kurisu*. E-sports games like LOL gives feeling of affiliation. Independent games are artworks of the modern times. They are great to bring strangers together as a topic.
