# The Very First Post

Hi there, this is my first blog post. Hoping it will be the starting of a legend 🚀!

**What I'm gonna do** in this website includes:

- 🖨 Write blogs about topics in studying Computer Science and Technologies, including tips of programming languages, algorithm problems and so on. 
- 🐵 Add self introductions and portfolios, and upload my CV in the future. 

​	This website is built by following the Gatsby Tutorial, and is available at https://github.com/MakiseJiang/my-site. Next I want to study basic front-end knowledges to make it look nicer.
